## 🚀 What is MakFuzz?

**MakFuzz** is a powerful, desktop-based fuzzy search utility designed to help you clean your data and remove duplicates. Whether you need to tidy up customer records, match messy lists, or search for names that sound similar, MakFuzz makes it easy.

This application uses advanced techniques to improve matching accuracy. It combines **Spelling Similarity** (how it looks) with **Phonetic Similarity** (how it sounds). This gives you the best results when searching for similar entries, ensuring you find what you need quickly.
